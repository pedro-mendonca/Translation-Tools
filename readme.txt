Translation tools for your WordPress install.

== Description ==

### Use any Locale, with or without Language Packs ###

With core Language Packs you can easily change the language of your WordPress install.

The Language Packs used to be provided only for 100% translated Locales.

To give teams with less contributors a better chance to get WordPress released into their Locale, since [22nd February 2021](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2021/02/22/wordpress-5-7-ready-to-be-translated/) the required translation status for core Language Packs to be built are as follows:

*   The [Front-end project](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/) needs to be translated at least <strong>90%</strong>.
*   The [Administration project](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/admin/) needs to be translated at least <strong>75%</strong>.
*   The [Network Admin](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/admin/network/) and [Continent & Cities](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/cc/) projects are not included in the threshold calculation.

If you need a Locale that has no Language Packs yet, this tool helps you by enabling ALL Locales on the list of the available languages.

### Compatible with plugin [Preferred Languages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/preferred-languages/) ###

The plugin [Preferred Languages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/preferred-languages/) overrides the standard languages field for site and user languages.

All the features added by Translation Tools are available for Preferred Languages users.

### Update your WordPress, Plugins or Themes translation, on demand ###

If you need to update your WordPress core, Plugins or Themes translations on demand without waiting for a language pack to be generated, this tool allows you to manually update all the needed files for the installed version, with one click, in a few seconds.

Go to "Translations" on the Updates screen and choose what you want to update.

#### All WordPress core sub-projects ####

*   Development
*   Continents & Cities
*   Administration
*   Network Admin

#### All translation files ####

*   .po (editable translation files)
*   .mo (binary translation files)
*   .l10n.php (PHP performant translation files)
*   .json (JavaScript translation files)

### WordPress Translations tests and info in Site Health ###

Check your WordPress core translations in Site Health tests page.

The Site Health debug info shows the selected site and user languages, including multiple languages from the plugin Preferred Languages.
